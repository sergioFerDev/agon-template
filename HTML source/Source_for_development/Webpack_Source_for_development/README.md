## Technologies used

- Templating: `Pug`
- Styling: `Sass` *you can also use stylus*
- Scripting: `jQuery or VanillaJS(plain Javascript)`
- JS Compiler: `Babel ES6 ES7 ES8 ES9 ES10 ES11 ES12` (that means you can use async/await, replaceAll, optional chaining... among many others)

## Don't like jQuery?
- You can remove it from the packages and from the Webpack config file and by removing it, your final build will be considerably reduced in size.

## Features

- Well organized folder structure for views, styles, and assets.
- Webpack notifier on every compilation.
- Compatibility with `manifest`, `browserconfig`, and other external files you wish to include.
- `Babel module resolver` configured to use alias and simplify the paths you need to import.
- `Editorconfig`
- Yarn.
- PostCSS.
